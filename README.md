## Getting Started

### 1. Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** v18 or later (we use v23)
- **npm** (comes with Node.js)
- **Git**

Node.js can be installed [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download). Once downloaded, you can check your Node version with:

```bash
node -v
```

### 2. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/devsuoa/contribute-to-open-source-workshop-2025.git
cd contribute-to-open-source-workshop-2025
```

### 3. Environment Variables

There are two `.env` files. One of them should be placed in the `frontend` folder, the other should be placed in the `backend` folder.

Create a frontend `.env` and add the following line:

```env
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

Create a backend `.env` and add the following line:

```env
PORT=3000
```

Your project tree should look like this:

![env](/frontend/public/images/env.png)

‚ÄºÔ∏è‚ÄºÔ∏èNote that this is for demonstration purposes only. **DO NOT** ever leak your `.env` content to the public, treat them like passwords.

### 4. Install Dependencies

`npm install` in both the `frontend` and `backend` directory seperately:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

### 5. Initialise Database

Run the `init-db.ts` script in `backend/src/db` by the following command (while in the `backend` directory):

```bash
npm run init-db
```

This will clear the existing database and populate it with the values defined in the script. The database is located at `backend/database.sqlite`.

### 6. Start the App

`npm run dev` in both the `frontend` and `backend` directory seperately. In other words, run `npm run dev` for both the frontend and backend in separate terminal tabs:

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
```

### 7. Login Credentials

Username: `alice`

Password: `password123`

The login credentials will be saved for 1 hour, afterwards you need to login again.

## Making a Contribution

These git actions can be performed anywhere in the project directory (unless there is a git submodule, which we don't in this example).

### 1. Create a Branch

```bash
git checkout -b your-branch-name
```

There are usually naming conventions for branches. For introducing a new feature, use `feature/your-feature-name`. For fixing a bug, use `bugfix/your-bug-name`.

### 2. Commit Changes

After you have made changes, stage and commit them to your local repository:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message"
```

### 3. Push Changes

Push you changes so everyone else can see them:

```bash
git push origin your-branch-name
```

After sucessfully pushing, you should be able to see a notification on GitHub to create a pull request.

### 4. Create a Pull Request

Click on "Compare & pull request", add a description of your changes, and submit the pull request.

The description usually includes:

- A description on the purpose and effect of the change
- How to test if the change works as intended

### 5. Checks and Review

Now your pull request is ready for review. However, it needs to pass the formatting and linting checks first.

![review](/frontend/public/images/review.png)

If it fails like the image above, go into your `frontend` and `backend` directories and run:

```bash
npm run format
npm run lint
```

Then commit these automatic changes and push again.

## Activities

We are excited to announce the DEVS online contest platform üéâüéâüéâ! However, due to underpaid and overworked developers, there are some ~~unintended bugs~~ "unique features" üëÄ. We need your help to make it better!

### Easy

#### E1: No Sekrit Dokuments

Currently, when you make a submission the expected value will be shown in the submissions tab. We don't want that! Remove it on the frontend.

#### E2: One Minute to Midnight

Add some visual effects to the competition timer when there is less than 1 minute left.

### Medium

#### M1: Seeing Double

In `backend/src/routes/api/submissions.ts`, the POST method to make a submission will create a new entry to the `competition_user_status` table every time a submission is made. We don't need to do that if the user already has a previous entry to this competition!

#### M2: Base Defender

Some paths are not protected, meaning that the user can land directly on them by typing the full url. For example, a user can skip the home page and go directly to a competition page, causing the database to not create an entry for this user. We need to protect these paths by redirecting the user to other paths when they are trying to access them directly.

**Hint**: We can track the previous page that the user is on in a context and require some pages to have a specific previous page. For example, competition page requires home. If the user tried to access competition page directly, the previous page is `null` and they will be redirected to home instead. If they are doing it properly, the previous page should be `home`.

### Hard

#### H1: New Guy Onboard

Instead of using mock users, we want new users to be able to register themselves. Implement a registration page and the corresponding backend logic that adds the new user to the database.

#### H2: Rank Does In Fact Matter

The database keeps track of points scored by each user in each competition. Implement a leaderboard page that shows the ranking of users based on their total points in a competition. (Some of the UI components are already exising somewhere in the codebase, you just need to find them üòâ)
